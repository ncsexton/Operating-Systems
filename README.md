# Operating-Systems
Projects focused around operating systems and the way that they manage memory.

Matrix Memory Manager uses a struct Matrix, and uses malloc and memory freeing, with pointers to the matrix values to create and display the matrix like one would in linear algebra.

Producer-Consumer System creates and checks that a search tree is both a binary search tree and a complete binary tree. The tree generates an in order traversal that retrieves the items in the sorted order, and is of minimum height and balanced. A large list of CDs is used to populate the tree.
